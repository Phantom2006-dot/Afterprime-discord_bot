## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Bot doesn't respond to commands:**
- Make sure bot has proper permissions in the server
- Check bot is online (should show as online in member list)
- Try restarting the bot workflow

**OAuth fails:**
- Verify redirect URLs match exactly in platform settings
- Check that secrets are set correctly
- Ensure platform apps are approved/live

**Role sync doesn't work:**
- Verify bot has "Manage Roles" permission
- Ensure bot's role is higher than the roles it's trying to assign
- Check that role IDs in secrets match your actual Discord roles

**Posts don't appear on social media:**
- Check console logs for API errors
- Verify platform tokens are valid
- Ensure you have proper permissions on the platform
